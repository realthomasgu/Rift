//! Airlock on the system bus: `dev.rift.Airlock` at `/dev/rift/Airlock`.
//!
//! `List` returns every app the system installation has as a Flatpak app, every app whose network
//! is off, and every app that runs in a sandbox now. `SetNetwork` turns an app's network off or
//! on, in the sandboxes it runs in now and in every one it starts later, and keeps the apps that
//! are off in a file. `Starting` is what `airlock start` asks from inside the scope of a new
//! sandbox before bwrap runs: when the app's network is off, the scope's is cut before the answer
//! goes back.
//!
//! A Flatpak app never asks as it starts, so the switch writes it an override that unshares its
//! network instead, which flatpak reads for every instance it starts after that. The scopes of the
//! instances already running are cut the same way a sandbox's is. When the service starts it makes
//! its table again from the file and the scopes that run, and writes the overrides of the system
//! installation from the file too, so the file is what the drive says. The table stays when the
//! service stops, so what is off stays off.
